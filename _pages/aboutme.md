Hi, I'm Erlite, a 22 years-old game developer from France.

After finishing college in the UK under a Game Design and Development course, I decided to jump in the industry directly instead of pursuing higher education.

As such, I became a C# and C++ Programmer, mostly working in gameplay and networking code for games, using both Unity and Unreal Engine (even though the latter is my favorite!).

I'm a big fan of anime and guns (if I wasn't a game dev, I probably would've went into gunsmithing). My contact info is on the left if you have any questions about my blog posts (or if you want to hire me).

I currently work at Periscope Games, as a Senior Gameplay Programmer for [Post Scriptum](https://store.steampowered.com/app/736220/Post_Scriptum/).

## Knowledge

- C# (about 6 years)
- C++ (about 4 years)
- Lua (mostly scripting mods for games like Garry's Mod)
- Unity 
- Unreal Engine 4 & 5
  - Gameplay Programming and Networking
