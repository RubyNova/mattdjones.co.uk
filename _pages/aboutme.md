Hi, I'm Erlite, a 22 year old game developer from France.

After finishing college in the UK under a Game Design and Development course, I decided to jump in the industry directly instead of pursuing higher education.

As such, I became a C# and C++ Programmer, mostly working in gameplay and networking code for games, using both Unity and Unreal Engine (even though the latter is my favorite!).

I'm a big fan of anime and guns (if I wasn't a game dev, I probably would've went into gunsmithing). My contact info is on the left if you have any questions about my blog posts (or if you want to hire me).

You can find some of my open source work on [Github](https://github.com/Erlite/).

I currently work at Periscope Games, as a Senior Gameplay Programmer for [Post Scriptum](https://store.steampowered.com/app/736220/Post_Scriptum/).
