Hello there kind reader! I'm Matt, or as most people know meon the internet, RubyNova - a Welsh game developer who lives in the UK!

I am a Microsoft MVP for Developer Technologies and a massive advocate for .NET, C#, and C++ as my friends would probably attest to by the fact I talk about it almost all the time. As such, its probably no surprise that I happen to own the [C# community Discord](https://discord.gg/csharp) that is linked to by the .NET Foundation itself.

I also absolutely love games development, graphics/rendering programming especially. So much so that I got the insane idea to write my own game engine with a few friends. It's easily the project I am most passionate about, and have sunk the most time into. The game engine, [NovelRT](https://github.com/NovelRT/NovelRT), is probably my most creative outlet, and I am hoping long-term it will become really viable as FOSS. I also oversee, and support the development of, a Lua-based narrative scripting language called [Fabulist](https://github.com/NovelRT/Fabulist).

I happen to spend much of my time in both Unity and Unreal Engine as well, either for work or for game jams (Ludum Dare is great fun!). It was certainly an interesting transition when taking my BSc. Hons. in Games Design & Development from regular .NET and C#, but definitely a transition I am happy I made! It was what originally got me into graphics programming, with the exposure to shader programming, particle systems, lighting, etc.

This website will serve as a mirror to my [GitHub](https://github.com/RubyNova) portfolio, as well as my personal blogging site where I'll probably write about different tech bits from time to time.

I hope you enjoy the adventure with me!
