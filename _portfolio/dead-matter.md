> Dead Matter, by indie company Quantum Integrity Software Inc., is a zombie survival rogue-lite set in a near future, post-apocalyptic Alberta. Bringing together various, handpicked elements of the open-world survival genre, along with our own original touches, Dead Matter aims to quench the communityâ€™s thirst for a title to properly balance survival mechanics with fulfilling gameplay.

The project has seen two successful crowdfunding campaigns, the first on [Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/qisoftware/dead-matter), and the other on [Indiegogo](https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/dead-matter#/).

## Responsibilities

- Gameplay Programming
  - Implementation of the game's basic mechanics, such as environmental actors like lights and elevators, items, weapons and more.
  - Saving and loading of the game's state & players via a custom made SQLite wrapper. 
  - Regular profiling of the game's performance and bandwidth usage, and tweaks in order to keep them ready for high player counts.
- Editor Tools
  - Minimap generator for a map item.
  - Housekeeping tools to keep the project clean and fix asset issues in bulk. 
  - Level Design oriented tools for the level design team.
- Lead Programmer
  - Lead newer members of the team through the codebase, helping them understand it and proceed with their tasks.
  - Ensure proper application of the codebase's coding standards, and make sure code is kept maintainable at all times.
